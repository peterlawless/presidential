## Synopsis

The purpose of this repository is to understand fundamentals of Database Schema
design, and understand basic SQL syntax to create tables, query for data,
insert data, and create helper functions to allow for easier interaction with
your database.

 and <a href="http://postgresapp.com/">Postgres</a> so that you can host PostgreSQL on your machine.


## Acknowledgements
 The data file used in this repository was is a csv containing data about the tenure of
 U.S. Presidents since inception taken from Niclas Darville's <a href=https://github.com/ndarville/d3-charts>d3-charts</a>
 repository.  Thanks for making this data available.


## Instructions
 The prezengine.py file in this repository, when run in the command line, will
 prompt the user whether to query the database by the features of the database
 or to write new data into the database.  This allows a tech-savvy revisionist
 historian to run wild with all the "what-ifs" of American electoral politics.
